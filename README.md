Individual Task:Time-Based: Employ timers and events for animation.

I chose the second personal task, Time-Based: Employ timers and events for animation. I will animate it based on the group code, especially using time elements. Firstly, I have introduced an array called rs based on the original second paragraph of code, which is used to store the properties of each rectangle, such as position, width, height, color, and transparency. And I will use arrays to create animation effects, change the value of rs to achieve maximum or minimum transparency, change the direction of the animation, increase and decrease the transparency of the rectangle within a certain time interval, and then achieve the transparency animation effect of the rectangle. Finally, adjust the interval time of calculation time, and change the speed value to control the entire animation speed.The final presentation in my personal task is the animation effect where the transparency of the colored blocks changes based on speed. The purpose of this design is to add a sense of mystery to the restlessness and distortion created by the color block shape designed by the group, and to express the mystery through fuzzy and clear constantly changing color blocks.
